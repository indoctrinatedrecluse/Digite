    <h1>Learn CSS 3.0 for better web design</h1><hr>
    <div class="divcls">Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is
    no path and leave a trail.</div>

    <div>It is always the simple that produces the marvelous.</div>
    <div id="divid">As knowledge increases, wonder deepens.</div>

    <p id="parid">For beautiful eyes, look for the good in others; for beautiful
    lips, speak only words of kindness; and for poise, walk with the
    knowledge that you are never alone.</p>

    <p>The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen
    or even touched - they must be felt with the heart.</p>

    <p class="parcls">It is during our darkest moments that we must focus to see the
    light.</p>

    <p>Happiness is not something you postpone for the future; it is
    something you design for the present.</p>

    <p>Be faithful to that which exists within yourself.</p>
